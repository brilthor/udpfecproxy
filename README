udpfwd -- Userspace UDP relay.
==============================

Think of it as poor man's single-port UDP DNAT/SNAT.

Usage:

	./udpfwd <dest_ip> <dest_port> <listen_port>

The relay listens for packets received on listen_port, changes their source
IPs to the IP of the local host ("SNAT"), and forwards them to the
destination (dest_ip:dest_port) from a randomly chosen local send_port. The
selection of send_port is made on reception of the first packet from a given
source_ip:source_port; once chosen, the source_ip:source_port:send_port
triplet is unique, allowing for connection tracking. Therefore, when a
packet is received on send_port, its destination is changed to
source_ip:source_port ("DNAT"), and forwarded onwards.

Effectively, this is a userspace SNAT/DNAT.

Schematic:

                         +----------------+
 [host_a:xxxx] <-------> |          a_out:| <-------> [                   ]
 [host_b:yyyy] <-------> |:listen   b_out:| <-------> [ dest_ip:dest_port ]
 [host_c:zzzz] <-------> |          c_out:| <-------> [                   ]
                         +----------------+

Warnings:

This relay has no authentication or authorization mechanisms, nor
does it in any way obscure or encrypt the forwarded packets. You
have been warned.

Building and Installing
=======================

A simple

	make

should do. Then copy the executable `udpfwd' to wherever you like (e.g.,
/usr/local/bin).
